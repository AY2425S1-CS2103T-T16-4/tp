# Teletutors User Guide

Teletutors is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having 
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teletutors can get your contact management tasks 
done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T16-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Teletutors.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar teletutors.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="zoom: 50%"/>

5. Pressing the **up arrow key (↑)** and **down arrow key (↓)** will recall the valid commands entered, allowing for modification of previous commands, similar to a command terminal

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `adds n/John Doe p/98765432 tg/G17 sn/A1234567Z` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Teletutor contact list.

   * `deletes n/John Doe` : Deletes the contact with the name John Doe.

   * `deleteall` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `adds n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `adds n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [sn/STUDENT_NUMBER]` can be used as `n/John Doe sn/A1234567Z` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `deleteall`, `undo`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Name arguments with extra whitespaces between words will be reduced to a single whitespace. 
  e.g. `n/John    Doe` will be treated as `n/John Doe`.

* Tutorial group and student number arguments are not case-sensitive. 
  e.g. `tg/G17` is the same as `tg/g17` and `sn/A1234567Z` is the same as `sn/a1234567z`.

### Saving the data

Teletutors data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Teletutors data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/teletutors.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Teletutors will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Teletutors to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Teletutors home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
